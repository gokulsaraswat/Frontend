## Must go through reactjs.org/docs

Search React Events list : syntheticEvent-React 
	Here onChange = Camel case 
HTML Dom Events or Javascript events 

Rather than using without writing class let us use state 
function comp use kare rather than class let us use

Use state 
to update data in DOM { in js we use innerhtml like but it's lengthy for array and stuff so it is more preferable }
and use effect 

const array = [ "a" , "b"]
const [ a , b ]=array; 
<!-- destructuring the array -->

[state,setState] is and convention
