# THREE JS game style immersive slider selection screen

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/ryzvqG](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/ryzvqG).

This is my first proper crack at creating something in THREE.js! You'll probably find a lot of the JS is sloppy and unoptimized but that's why its here for you to look at on Codepen, I need your suggestions and opinions so I can better at using THREE.

The transitions are done by using GSAP's timeline max and the 3D UI is built using my deepUI JS plugin.

I honestly have no idea how I got to the final product. The concept began as just a simple product slider in THREE JS and eventually became more and more complicated as the development went on. The game the scene apparently belongs to is completely fictional and none of this will be used in production of course :)
