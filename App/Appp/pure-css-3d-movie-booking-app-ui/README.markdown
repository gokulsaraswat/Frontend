# Pure CSS 3D Movie Booking App UI

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/JOYazv](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/JOYazv).

A nice little movie ticket booking app UI. All done in CSS , no JS. 

A literal conversion of this design on Dribbble:

It's a touch glitchy with the blurs on edge but other than that it's fine.  Great in Chrome, Firefox and Opera.
