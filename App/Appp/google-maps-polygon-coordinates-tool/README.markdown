# Google Maps Polygon Coordinates Tool

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jhawes/pen/ujdgK](https://codepen.io/jhawes/pen/ujdgK).

Outputs the coordinates (longitude, latitude) for Google Maps whenever the Polygon is moved or re-shaped. Recently added a 'Copy to Clipboard' button and had data output into a textarea for easier copying & pasting

I originally built this to build map outlines for neighborhoods, villages, districts and counties - specifically for real estate purposes.
