# Opening screen for a banking app 

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/kiyutink/pen/ddMdwm](https://codepen.io/kiyutink/pen/ddMdwm).

This pen is inspired by an amazing dribbble shot by Jakub Reis: https://dribbble.com/shots/2716909-Opening-screen-for-banking-App . It has a lot of stuff happening - some SVG animations using requestAnimationFrame, some GSAP and some css transitions.  It looks the smoothest on Chrome, so I recommend using that :)

I wrote an article about how I made this: https://css-tricks.com/creating-an-animated-login-form-for-touchid/
