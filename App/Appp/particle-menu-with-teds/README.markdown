# Particle menu with Teds

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/aBomML](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/aBomML).

Uses canvas's get image data function to grab pixel data from a canvas. The outputs them, shuffles the array and finally uses tween max to animate each particle. I've purposefully left clear canvas off to give it a nice effect but can be turned back on by uncommenting line 161
